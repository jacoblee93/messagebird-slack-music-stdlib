# Hackathon Demo

StdLib demo code. `recommendMusic` combines a service that creates music
recommendations with the Messagebird API to send text messages.

`slack-app` is a Slack app that contains a slash command that calls the
`recommendMusic` service. Changes are in `slack-app/functions/commands/hello.js`.
